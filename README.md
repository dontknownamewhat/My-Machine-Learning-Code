This is a code about my machine learning class."My learning.py"is about linear regression and the rest of this file are same as it named.
It's a pity that there is something wrong with my Fully Connected Neural Networks.Because I didn't completely understand the meaning of the 
gradient descent part of the Fully Connected Neural Networks when I write the function of the gradient descent.So I get lots of wrong output 
when I run the code.It bother me for several weeks then one day I found out what's wrong:I didn't put the whole A into the gradient descent
function.I just put one sample A1 into it.Because I have spent too many time on it.So I have to give up and write a sinple version with the
help of CSDN.
